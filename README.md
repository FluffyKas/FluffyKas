# Hey there!

I'm Zs√≥fi. I used to be a barista and brew coffee on a daily basis until I discovered how cool coding is. I love learning and creating new things. Right now, I spend a lot of time building [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) projects and doing my best to [help](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/FluffyKas/comments) others, but my goal is to become a professional web developer one day!

I also enjoy playing board games and video games in my free time.
