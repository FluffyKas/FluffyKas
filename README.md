## Hey there, I'm Kas :raising_hand:

<br/>

I'm a self-taught frontend developer (or at least aspiring to become one)! I started my coding journey in January 2021.

- :construction: Iâ€™m currently working on some [FEM](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/FluffyKas)  projects for my portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, React
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone who's interested (never did but I'd love to try!)
- ðŸ’¬ I'm happy to talk about: anything web dev related (accessibility and css in particular), video games, coffee, BIRDS :baby_chick:
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zsofi-maruzs-a5a703216/) or per email(maruzs.zso@gmail.com)
- :heart: Fun fact: can't decide between coffee and tea
