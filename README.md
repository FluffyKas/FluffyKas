### About Me

I'm an aspiring frontend developer, embarked on a coding journey in January 2021. I'm currently based in Hungary but that changes by the year. :smile:
My real name is ZsÃ³fi but online I'm usually called Kas (it's your choice which one you prefer).

- :construction: Iâ€™m currently working on some FEM projects for my portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone who's interested (never did but I'd love to try!)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything web dev related or about video games, books or BIRDS :baby_chick:
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: check out my linkedin or email
- :heart: Fun fact: can't decide between coffee and tea
